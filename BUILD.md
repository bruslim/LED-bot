LED Screen Build Notes

Hardware
----
After some fussing we found Trammell Hudson's really excellent [Octoscroller](http://trmm.net/Octoscroller) project to interface with our low-level hardware.

Buy a [BeagleBone Black](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1876), some [LED Panels](https://www.adafruit.com/product/420) and a nice [5V power supply](https://www.adafruit.com/products/658) and an [Octoscroller cape](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/7mSHNZcD). You can order the cape circuit board in sets of 3 from OSH Park! It takes two-three weeks.

Make a [DigiKey](http://www.digikey.com) order. Here are the parts you want:

| Quantity   | Part Number  | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1  | 296-8503-5-ND  | 8-bit bus transceiver |
|  8 | S9171-ND  | 16 pin ribbon connector |
|  4 | S1012E-36-ND | Breakable header pins | 


Solder your hardware. The buffer IC goes on the underside of the circuit board. The hole in the ribbon cable connectors face towards the bottom of the PCB.

These LED panels use a lot of power. Make sure you have an aedequet power supply or you may experience funny issues.

Software
----

First you need to install [LEDscape](https://github.com/osresearch/LEDscape/) on the Beaglebone.

Follow their newly written [setup instructions](https://github.com/osresearch/LEDscape/blob/master/Setup.md).

Download [LED-bot](https://github.com/marqsm/LED-bot).

    git clone https://github.com/marqsm/LED-bot

You can install the python dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file

    pip install -r requirements.txt
