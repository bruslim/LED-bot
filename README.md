=========

![marquee](./test/marquee1.gif)

A LED application server. Stream images, messages and more to LEDs in your home, office, hacker space.

Currently pipeline is working, supports to commands.

| command                              | parameters         | 
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| ```led-bot show-image <imagename>``` | image needs to be on the same server & directory where bot is running.  |
| ```led-bot show-text <text>```       | text supports currently only 1 word.  |


TODO:
- Fix to support longer texts for "show-text"
- add support to animated gifs
- Add commands for sampling / scrolling images, if they are too big for the screen
- Add possibility to move an image across the screen (like immobile pacman) - of course way cooler with animated gifs
- Errorhandling for image loading - now pretty weak 
- Make a message queue for incoming messages
- Make some kind of scheduler to decide how long to show messages

DONE:  
x Hardware soldering  
x fetch remote images (url)

x Learn OpenPixel file format  
x Build Zulip bot  
x Get communication from server to hardware  
x Figure out conversion from raw data to OpenPixel format  

Goal:

(done) 1. Reference app running from network to HW
